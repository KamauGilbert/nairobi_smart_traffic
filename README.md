# Nairobi Smart Traffic Project 🚦

Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my **Nairobi Smart Traffic** project. This is a small yet ambitious initiative to tackle traffic challenges using modern data tools and APIs. To get a better understanding of the problem, feel free to check out the [problem statement](https://github.com/KamauGilbert/nairobi_smart_traffic/blob/main/problem%20statement.jpeg).

## Project Approach 🚀

I’ve broken the project down into the following key steps:

1. **Data Extraction with Google Maps API**  
   - Learn how to work with the Google Maps API and explore Google Cloud Platform (GCP) functionalities.  

2. **Road Information via Twitter/X API**  
   - Use Twitter/X API to extract real-time traffic-related data and insights.  

3. **Data Storage**  
   - Store the collected data in a structured database for further processing and analysis.  

4. **Automation with Apache Airflow**  
   - Automate the data scraping and processing pipeline to keep information up to date.  

5. **Testing & Deployment**  
   - Test the system end-to-end and deploy a robust solution.

## What’s Next? 📝

I’ll dive deeper into the technical details and share insights from this project in an upcoming [dev.to](https://dev.to/) post. Stay tuned!  

Cheers!!!
